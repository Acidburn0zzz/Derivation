This project demonstrates, how the "Derivation" library could be used.

Console Input:
	function[[, x[, y[, z[, t]]]]]

Console Output:
	Entered function
	Calculated function result with entered values for x, y, z and t
	Partial derivative with respect to x, y, z and t
	Calculated derivation result with entered values for x, y, z and t

To exit enter "exit" or "quit".

Examples:
	Console Input: 
		> x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2, 1, 2, 3, 4
	Console Output:
		f(x, y, z, t) = ((((x ^ 2) + (y ^ 2)) + (z ^ 2)) + (t ^ 2))
		f(1, 2, 3, 4) = 30
		grad f(x, y, z, t) = ((2 * x), (2 * y), (2 * z), (2 * t))
		grad f(1, 2, 3, 4) = (2, 4, 6, 8)

	Console Input: 
		> sin(x^2), 3
	Console Output:
		f(x, y, z, t) = Sin((x ^ 2))
		f(3, 0, 0, 0) = 0.412118485241757
		grad f(x, y, z, t) = ((Cos((x ^ 2)) * (2 * x)), 0, 0, 0)
		grad f(3, 0, 0, 0) = (-5.46678157130806, 0, 0, 0)

If you see any "Internal parser error: ..." message please send me the function that triggered it.
